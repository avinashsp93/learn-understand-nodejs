JavaScript Big Words made simple

Event Listener - The code that responds to an event.

Magic String - A string that has some special meaning in our code.

Machine Code (Machine Language) - Programming languages spoken by computer processors. Every program you run on your computer has been converted (compiled) into machine code.

ECMAScript - The standard Javascript is based on. Needed a standard since there are many JS Engines.

Javascript Engine - A program that converts JS code into something the computer processors can understand.

Breakpoint - A spot in our code where we tell a debugging tool to pause the execution of our code.

Module - A reusable block of code whose existence doesn't accidentally impact other code. Javascript did not have this feature before

CommonJS Modules - An agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured.

First Class Functions - Everything you can do with other types you can do with functions.

Expression - A block of code that results in a value.

Invoke - Run the function.

Name/Value Pair - A name which maps to a value.

Object - A collection of name/value pairs.

Object Literal - Name/value pairs seperated by commas and surrounded by curly braces.

Inheritance - One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object.

Function Constructors - A normal function that is used to construct objects.
The 'this' variable points to a new empty object, and that object is returned from the function automatically.

Primitive - A type of data that represents a single value.
Like a number or a string, not an object in general in javascript.

Scope - Where in code you have access to particular variable or function.

JSON - A standard for structuring data that is inspired by javascript object literals.
Javascript engines are built to understand it.

Revealing Module Pattern - Exposing only the properties and methods you want via the returned object.
A very common and clean way to structure and protect code within modules.

Mutate - To change something.
For example, adding a method or a property to an object means you mutate the object.

Event Listener - The code that responds to an event.
In javascript's case the listener will be a function.

Template Literal - A way to concatenate strings in Javascript (ES6).
Easier to work with than a bunch of strings concatenated with '+'.
